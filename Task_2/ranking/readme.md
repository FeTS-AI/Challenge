# Task 2 Ranking

>Update: We also implemented a Python-based version in the [paper analysis folder](../../paper_analysis/plots_task2.py), which gives identical results. This part is kept in case you are interested in the full challengeR reports.

This is an implementation of the ranking method described on the [challenge website](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn28546456/wiki/617245). To run this on your computer, you need to install R and the challengeR toolkit, as described in their [repository](https://github.com/wiesenfa/challengeR/#installation). The script `compute_ranking.R` should be invoked by
```
Rscript compute_ranking.R data_path [report_save_dir]
```
and takes two positional arguments as input: 
- `data_path` specifies the path to the directory that contains yaml-files with the evaluation results (there will be one for each testing institution in the federated evaluation).
- `report_save_dir` (optional) specifies the path to the directory where ranking analysis reports should be saved to. If not present, no reports are created.

The script outputs the final ranking to stdout.

Each yaml file is expected to have the following format (see also the example file):
```
patient_id0:
    algorithm_id0:
        WT:
            Dice: ...
            Hausdorff95: ...
        TC:
            Dice: ...
            Hausdorff95: ...
        ET:
            Dice: ...
            Hausdorff95: ...
    algorithm_id1:
        WT:
            Dice: ...
            Hausdorff95: ...
        TC:
            Dice: ...
            Hausdorff95: ...
        ET:
            Dice: ...
            Hausdorff95: ...
    ...
patient_id1:
    ...
```
