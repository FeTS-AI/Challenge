    "# Getting access to historical weights, metrics, and more\n",
    "The **db_iterator** parameter gives full access to all of the tensors and metrics stored by the aggregator. Participants can access these records to create advanced aggregation methods, hyperparameters for training, and novel selection logic for which collaborators should participant in a given training round. See below for details about how data is stored internally and a comprehensive set of examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Form\n",
    "Each record yielded by the `db_iterator` contains the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                      TensorKey                     |   Tensor  |\n",

    "| 'tensor_name', 'origin', 'round', 'report', 'tags' | 'nparray' |\n",
    "\n",
    "All records are internally stored as a numpy array: model weights, metrics, as well as hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed field explanation:\n",
    "- **'tensor_name'** (str): The `'tensor_name'` field corresponds to the model layer name (i.e. `'conv2d'`), or the name of the metric that has been reported by a collaborator (i.e. `'accuracy'`). The built-in validation functions used for evaluation of the challenge will be given a prefix of `'challenge_metric_\\*'`. The names that you provide in conjunction with a custom validation metrics to the ```run_challenge_experiment``` function will remain unchanged.  \n",
    "- **'origin'** (str): The origin denotes where the numpy array came from. Possible values are any of the collaborator names (i.e. `'col1'`), or the aggregator.\n",
    "- **'round'** (int): The round that produced the tensor. If your experiment has `N` rounds, possible values are `0->N-1`\n",
    "- **'report'** (boolean): This field is one of the ways that a metric can be denoted; For the purpose of aggregation, this field can be ignored.\n",
    "- **'tags'** (tuple(str)): The tags include unstructured information that can be used to create complex data flows. For example, model layer weights will have the same `'tensor_name'` and `'round'` before and after training, so a tag of `'trained'` is used to denote that the numpy array corresponds to the layer of a locally trained model. This field is also used to capture metric information. For example, `aggregated_model_validation` assigns tags of `'metric'` and `'validate_agg'` to reflect that the metric reported corresponds to the validation score of the latest aggregated model, whereas the tags of `'metric'` and `'validate_local'` are used for metrics produced through validation after training on a collaborator's local data.   \n",
    "- **'nparray'** (numpy array) : This contains the value of the tensor. May contain the model weights, metrics, or hyperparameters as a numpy array.\n"

    "Standard aggregation methods allow for simple layer-wise combination (via weighted_mean, mean, median, etc.); however, more complex aggregation methods can be supported by evaluating collaborator metrics, weights from prior rounds, etc. OpenFL enables custom aggregation functions via the [**AggregationFunctionInterface**](https://github.com/intel/openfl/blob/fets/openfl/component/aggregation_functions/interface.py). For the challenge, we wrap this interface so we can pass additional simulation state, such as simulated time.\n",

Your custom aggregation function will be passed a list of LocalTensors, which will contain an entry for each collaborator who participated in the prior training round. The [**`db_iterator`**](#Getting-access-to-historical-weights,-metrics,-and-more) can be used to construct complex aggregation methods. A few examples are included below.\n",
